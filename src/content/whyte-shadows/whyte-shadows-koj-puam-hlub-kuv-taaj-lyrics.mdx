For your love I’ll try

You and me, Baby

Each day and night

Now Yeah

You will be in my heart

And always in my mind

I will think of you

Every moment every time

When I go

Will you let me be in you heart?

Oh yeah, Baby

I loved you from the start

All my love ‘til the next time

Every beat from my heart is

For you love

<br />

Koj puas hlub kuv taaj

Lawm yog koj rua laam hab

Lug txais kuv lub sab

Yog tsis muas sab taaj

Thov txhoj dlaam kuv

Yaam taamlug koj hab rua kuv

Kua nyaaj moog nyaaj

Koj yuav tug rua txujkev hlub

Kws ua kuv twjsab kawg kaus

Yog koj hlub kuv

Qha kua tseem

<br />

This time Baby

There will be no doubt

Show my love

Cannot sing, cannot shout

Out loud from my heart

And from my mouth

Kiss you over many times again

Can I reckon what I had

Tell me yea

<br />

Txawm taaj koj ua rua

Kuv twjsab los

Huv kuv lub sab

Kuv tseem hlub koj taaj

Yog koj yuav hlub kuv

Le koj taug has

Kuv mab qheb lub

Sab lug hlub koj

<br />

For your love I’ll fight

You and me, Baby

All my strength and

All my might

Your love is like a charm

In my heart all the time

I will love you ‘til the last breath

End of time

Can I be what you see?

Very good very please

Oh yea Baby

Show your real love

This moment that we must seize

This is our chance now

Show me how for you love

<br />

Kws txawm uya rua kuv luas

Puas kuv thaum kuv quas

Qheb qovroj rua kuv

Hlub kuv tsis kluas

Txawm sab wb siv ntsib

Pum kleeb nwg yeej luas ntxeev

Nwg saib kuv muas nubqej heev

Tsis pum kuv muas kev nyuaj sab

Kuv txawm ib tug hlub le nuav

<br />

Please don’t break my heart

And promise me

That you’ll love me

With all your heart

If you do, then me and you

Will see, that our love will

Grow and never die
